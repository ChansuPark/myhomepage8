					<h3>THEY WORK SO HARD AT SPURS TO BE AT THAT LEVEL' - DIER PRAISE FOR ROSE AND WALKER</h3>
					<p>“I call Kyle ‘the stallion’, because he’s like a racehorse, up and down that flank,” he told us after helping England to a 3-0 win over Scotland in World Cup qualifying at Wembley on Friday night.
					Eric partnered Jordan Henderson in the midfield engine room but our flying full-backs caught the eye charging up and down the right and left all night.
					Scotland had their moments but couldn’t contain Danny and Kyle, who played a huge part in all three England goals. Kyle whipped in a cross for Daniel Sturridge to open the scoring, Danny did the same for Adam Lallana for 2-0 and then another burst from the left-back won the corner from which Gary Cahill headed home number three. Of course, the pair’s performances were no surprise to us here at Spurs and the fact they both take their Club form onto the international stage is of huge credit to them both.
					“They are unbelievable physically, no-one can match them,” continued Eric at Wembley. “They offer so much both defensively and offensively.
					“I’m really happy for them and being involved in all three goals, that’s great for them as well. They deserve it because they work so hard at Spurs to be at that level.
					“They then show the same form in international football as well, which is great for Tottenham and England. I’m delighted for them, they were fantastic.”
					Winning his 14th cap in a little under 12 months, Eric relished his first England-Scotland experience.</p>

					<h3>INTERNATIONALS – ERIKSEN SCORES BRACE IN DENMARK VICTORY</h3>
					<p>Christian Eriksen scored a marvellous solo goal to add to his earlier penalty as Denmark gave their 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign a real boost with a 4-1 home win over Kazakhstan in Copenhagen on Friday night (November 11).
					he midfielder successfully converted a spot-kick for the home side after 36 minutes, putting them 2-1 in front, but it was his stoppage-time second to complete the scoring that stole the headlines.
					Collecting the ball inside the centre-circle, he dribbled his way through the visitors’ territory, produced a neat bit of skill to get between two Kazakhstan defenders and then slotted into the net from the left angle.
					The result leaves Denmark third in the Group E table on six points, four behind leaders Poland and one behind second-placed Montenegro.
					Elsewhere on Friday night, Hugo Lloris and Moussa Sissoko both played 90 minutes for France as they came back from a goal down to beat Sweden 2-1 in Paris. The result means Les Bleus are three points clear of Sweden at the top of Group A.
					As previously reported , Kyle Walker, Danny Rose and Eric Dier all completed the full game for England in their 3-0 win over Scotland at Wembley. Kyle and Danny provided the assists for the Three Lions’ first two goals while Danny also won the corner which led to England’s third. Harry Kane was an unused substitute.</p>

					<h3>SPURS WEEKEND PREVIEW - ALL THE FIXTURES FOR OUR SIDES...</h3>
					<p>The international break means there aren't as many domestic fixtures this weekend, but our Under-18s and Ladies sides are still in action. Here's a look at who they're playing and when...
					Under-18s
					SPURS v READING
					Under-18 Premier League
					Saturday, November 12, 2016
					Hotspur Way, 12pm
					Our youngsters are now half-way through their initial Under-18 Premier League southern division programme, meaning they face their first 'return' fixture on Saturday against Reading.
					The two sides shared seven goals when they met at the Royals' training ground earlier this season, Reading emerging as 4-3 winners, but with our Under-18s having secured three wins and a draw from their last four league fixtures, they'll be hoping for a better outcome this time.</p>
